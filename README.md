# Minus 7 Trainer

A touch-first browser trainer for the **Minus 7** strategy in *Five Nights at Freddy's 2*'s
10/20 mode. It is not a clone of the game: it is a drill machine for the input routine, built on a
reimplementation of the mechanics the strategy actually depends on.

**Canonical target:** the modern Android release-7 build (Fusion build 296,
August 2025). PC/community material is supporting research, not the simulator's
fidelity target.

Open it on a phone, turn sideways, and work down the lessons.

## What Minus 7 is

The classic strategy flashes **CAM 10**, **CAM 04** and **CAM 07** every five
seconds to hold seven animatronics on their routes. Foxy, Golden Freddy and
Balloon Boy are handled by hand.

The core loop, on every time ending in **2** or **7**:

> cams down → mask flick → flash the hall → cams up → CAM 10 → CAM 04 → CAM 07 → CAM 11 → wind

> **Android provenance (2026-08-20):** the 400-frame (6.67 s) camera-flash
> stall is **decompile-confirmed on the owned release-7 binary** — the flash
> groups load it from a `stun time` counter that nothing ever rewrites. A
> same-week audit briefly declared it disabled; that reading came from the
> runtime's XOR-scrambled object-handle table, now corrected in the tooling
> (a discovery that affects every Clickteam Android decompile). The corrected
> source model passes the shipped schedule 200/200; see
> [`ANDROID-CAMERA-STALL.md`](ANDROID-CAMERA-STALL.md).

Ten inputs in about 1.5 seconds, then three and a half seconds of winding. Full mechanical detail,
with sources, is in [MINUS-7-STRATEGY.md](MINUS-7-STRATEGY.md).

Strategy by **Niko Frost** (13 December 2023). This repo is a practice tool, not the strategy.

## Why a trainer

Minus 7 has no unwinnable RNG — every loss is a mechanical mistake. That makes it exactly the kind
of skill a drill machine can teach, and exactly the kind that is miserable to learn inside a
7-minute run where one slip ends the night.

## The lessons

Ten steps, each adding one thing and hiding every control it doesn't need:

| # | Lesson | Adds |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | The beat | tapping on `:X2` / `:X7`, nothing else on screen |
| 2 | The sweep | CAM 10 / 04 / 07 with the camera light |
| 3 | Sweep, then wind | CAM 11 and the hold-drag to WIND |
| 4 | Down and back | the office half: cams down, mask, hall flash, up |
| 5 | The whole cycle | both halves, nothing lethal |
| 6 | The cycle, for real | Foxy and Golden Freddy live |
| 7 | Hearing Balloon Boy | cams down across every 5s interval |
| 8 | The duel | the ~0.7s reaction window after his leaving bang |
| 9 | Full night | 7:00, real RNG |
| 10 | Worst luck | every roll pinned to the worst case |

Each needs N clean passes in a row to unlock the next. A rhythm lane shows the upcoming inputs
scrolling toward a hit line with their tolerance windows, the control you should touch next gets a
ring, and every input is graded in milliseconds.

Every screen is a night-shift console: phosphor amber on warm black, and anything you are timed on
— clock, offsets, stun bars, the lane — set in mono with tabular figures, so a digit never shifts
under your eye. Each control keeps one colour everywhere it appears: the chip on the lesson brief,
the glyph on the rhythm lane and the button under your thumb all agree. `How it works` is the whole
strategy on one board — the ten-input pass, why the 6.66 s stun never lapses, the three rooms, and
what has to be handled by hand.

The two faces, **Chakra Petch** and **IBM Plex Mono**, ship with the repo as latin-subset woff2 in
`assets/fonts/` (both SIL OFL), so the trainer looks right on a phone with no internet.

**Timing is never slowed down.** The whole skill is absolute timing, so practising at 0.8× would
build the wrong reflexes. Lessons get easier by removing controls and threats, never by distorting
the clock — only the grading tolerance is loosened early on.

## Calibration

Button placement is the point of a touch trainer, so every control — all 12 cameras, both lights,
mask, monitor, vents and wind — can be dragged to move and resized by its corner handle.

`Settings → Calibrate layout` opens an inert session with the simulation stopped and game input
disabled, so dragging a control never doubles as pressing it. Overlapping controls are flagged red,
because overlapping touch targets silently swallow inputs.

`Settings → Save this layout as the code default` posts the layout to the dev server, which writes
it into `src/config.js` and rebuilds. Anywhere else, it hands you the JSON.

The shipped camera map is traced from a screenshot of the real in-game map and sized to that
image's aspect ratio, so the thumb path between 11 / 10 / 04 / 07 matches the game.

## Sound

Cues are synthesised — no audio files ship with this repo. Each control has its own pitch, so a
correct cycle has a recognisable tune and a wrong one is audibly wrong. There is an optional
metronome on the `:X2` / `:X7` anchors and haptic feedback on every input.

If you own FNaF 2 you can load sounds from your own copy into `Settings → Your own sounds`. They are
stored in IndexedDB on your device, are never uploaded, and are not part of the page. **No game
assets are distributed here.**

## Running it

The published copy is at **<https://ppvaz.github.io/fnaf2-minus7-practice/>** — served straight from
`master`, because the source runs as ES modules with nothing to build. Being https it is a secure
context, so wake lock and vibration work there; the LAN URL below is plain http and they do not.

No dependencies, no build step for development:

```sh
python3 tools/serve.py 8731      # serves the repo, and accepts saved layouts
```

Then open `http://<your-ip>:8731/index.html` on your phone, on the same network. The source runs
directly as ES modules — there is nothing to build for development.

For a single self-contained file (one HTML with every module, the CSS and the fonts inlined,
nothing external):

```sh
python3 tools/build.py           # -> dist/index.html
```

`dist/` is not committed. The bundler derives module order from the imports, so adding a file needs
no list to be updated.

Note that a plain-`http` LAN URL is not a secure context, so wake lock and vibration are disabled.

A run insists on full screen: browser chrome appearing or disappearing resizes the viewport, and
every control is placed as a percentage of it, so the buttons you calibrated would move under your
thumbs mid-run. If the request is refused or you leave full screen, a bar says so and the next touch
on the stage asks again.

## Tests

All headless, all dependency-free — the browser ones drive Chrome over the DevTools Protocol
(Node 22's built-in WebSocket), no Puppeteer.

```sh
node tools/simtest.mjs --sweep   # a perfect cycle vs. 200 seeds
node tools/bbtest.mjs 200        # ...including Balloon Boy; --worst for worst-luck
node tools/bbtest.mjs 60 --jitter=200   # how much lateness is survivable
node tools/lessontest.mjs        # drives the lesson ladder to a pass
node tools/caltest.mjs           # calibration, drag vs. press, layout saving
node tools/lightcheck.mjs        # the two lights swap with the monitor
node tools/browsertest.mjs       # load, input, report
node tools/cyclesearch.mjs       # search cycle variants for timing slack (--curve: just baseline)
node tools/strategysearch.mjs    # enumerate route-graph camera covers (--quick for a smoke pass)
node tools/rvctest.mjs 200       # probe a PC-origin RVC policy against Android (not published odds)
```

What they establish:

- A correctly played cycle clears **200/200 seeds**, and **100/100 on worst luck**, with zero stun
  lapses — matching the community's claim that Minus 7 has no unwinnable RNG.
- The difficulty curve is real: survivable up to ~120 ms late, ~35% at 200 ms, dead past 300 ms.

## Accuracy

The canonical mechanics source is the owned modern-Android event-sheet extraction.
Community PC reverse engineering is retained as attributed supporting research, not
silently merged into Android rules. Constants are marked `[SOURCED]`, `[CALIBRATED]`,
or `[INFERRED]` in `src/config.js`; the live implementation gaps are tracked in
[Android source status](ANDROID-SOURCE-STATUS.md). The
[office endgame audit](ANDROID-OFFICE-ENDGAME.md) pins the exported camera/mask
states and the 45-frame defense / 300-frame resolution chain. The
[PC confirmation ledger](PC-DECOMP-CHECKLIST.md) is deferred and non-blocking.
Post-chokepoint routing remains an approximation: it only runs once you have already
broken the stun loop.
