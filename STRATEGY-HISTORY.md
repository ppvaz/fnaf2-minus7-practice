# FNaF 2 — 10/20 Mode: A History of the Strategies
### Consolidated from `MINUS-7-STRATEGY.md`, `MINUS-3-STRATEGY.md` and `VENT-CAMP-STRATEGY.md`, plus the 2026 Markiplier material. Researched 2026-08-19.

One night, 7 minutes, ten animatronics at maximum AI. Every strategy below is an
answer to the same question: how much of 10/20 mode's chaos can be converted into
schedule? The history runs from pure reaction play to two independent proofs that
the answer is *all of it*.

## The eras

**Reaction era (2014–~2020).** Camera-heavy play (DJ Sterf's "T Path" and kin):
watch, react, hope. Wins existed but were luck-shaped. This era also produced the
period's most famous win — Markiplier's December 2014 10/20 completion — which
turned out to matter to this history twice (see the saga below).

**Right Vent Camp (~2020–2023).** The "Tactical Crew" (Random FNaF Player, Ambience,
Tru3P1ay3r, Chezzball34, ZombieGabriel, Toy Bonnie 360 — credited by DJ Sterf)
found the load-bearing mask fact: 5 consecutive masked seconds clears everyone, so
the left side never needs checking. DJ Sterf systematised it (2021, in-phase /
out-of-phase); Shooter25 made it clock-driven (2021) by timing blackouts across
Foxy's kill checks. RVC turned 10/20 from a reflex test into a routine with a few
RNG leaks — Toy Bonnie chief among them.

**Stall era (2023–2025).** Two simultaneous discoveries converted "handle the
animatronics" into "never let them move at all":

- *Cam-stall* (Minus 3, insstaa + Yunivers, July 2023): the double camera glitch
  keeps Parts/Service selected all night, so the three stallable Withereds never
  leave. Easy, but glitch-based and not RNG-proof.
- *Flash-loop* (**Minus 7**, Niko Frost, December 2023): the three-camera flash
  sweep holds all seven stallable animatronics forever — the **first zero-RNG
  strategy**, glitchless, and the hardest to execute. The strategy this repo's
  trainer teaches.

**Synthesis era (2024–2026).** The threads merged and specialised:

- *brayden's timer strategy* (June 2024, with Shooter25): RVC + Foxy blackout
  manipulation + Golden Freddy interval avoidance + the right-vent-light Toy Bonnie
  stall. Not zero-RNG (~99%, bot-measured) but the best consistency-per-unit-skill —
  the pragmatist's strategy.
- *Minus Toys* (Zach_Scream, May 2025): the glitch aimed at CAM 09 instead, freezing
  the three Toys; the **second zero-RNG strategy**, far easier than Minus 7.
  *Minus Two* (a day later): the same plan glitchless via CAM 03 — zero-RNG,
  legitimate, but slack-starved.
- *Markiplier's rediscovery* (July 2026): see the saga.

## The Markiplier saga

- **2014-12-14** — Markiplier's original *10/20 Mode COMPLETE!!*, the era-defining
  win.
- **2025-11-14** — TheBones5 publishes a 41-minute technical analysis alleging the
  run was cheated; community debate follows.
- **2026-07-15** — Markiplier confesses on stream (*Markiplier's Redemption*, 4h23):
  the 2014 run was not legitimate.
- **2026-07-31** — *Five Nights at Freddy's 2: 10/20 COMPLETE (no cheats)*: he beats
  it for real, having deliberately avoided existing strategies and derived his own
  from mechanics — then discovers on finishing that he had **independently
  reinvented Minus 7** ("I realised this is a strategy called minus seven, or a
  modified version of it" — community verdict the same: "he really reinvented the
  minus 7 strat", TheBon).

His variant differs from Niko Frost's in three ways worth recording:

1. **No external timer.** Every prior clock-anchored strategy requires one; Mark
   counts 5-second cycles using the music box itself as the metronome (each wind
   tick is 0.5 s — "five, wind four, three winds…").
2. **Foxy is retired, not managed.** Instead of per-cycle hall flashes, he fills
   Foxy's exposure meter (700 units on night 7) in three flash rounds
   (≈5 s + 3.5 s + 3.5 s ≈ 11 s of light), deliberately *aligning Foxy's retreat
   with Balloon Boy's arrival* so both are dealt with in one window.
3. **Freeze-in-place at night start** — flashing CAM 7 / CAM 4 / CAM 10 from the
   opening (he notes CAM 4 beats CAM 2 because no phone ring masks Foxy's audio
   cues).

He is candid that his run had luck in it (it is not played as zero-RNG) and that the
method has optimisation headroom. Two details matter to this repo: he verified
Foxy's internals against **Shooter25's FNaF 2 practice mod** (the same bot lineage
in plan 05's prior-art note), and his on-camera measurements — the 6.66 s freeze,
the 700-unit meter, exposure accruing ~50–60 units per second with proportional
partial-second credit — are fresh independent confirmations of constants in
`src/config.js`, plus one refinement (sub-second exposure granularity) the engine
doesn't model.

## The scoreboard

| Strategy | Year | RNG-proof | Glitchless | Timer needed | Difficulty (community verdict) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Reaction / T Path | 2014– | no | yes | no | luck-shaped |
| Right Vent Camp | ~2020 | no | yes | no (yes once timed) | moderate |
| Minus 3 | 2023 | no | **no** | yes | easy |
| **Minus 7** | 2023 | **yes** | yes | yes | hardest |
| brayden's timer strat | 2024 | no (~99%) | yes | yes | moderate-easy |
| **Minus Toys** | 2025 | **yes** | **no** | yes | much easier than Minus 7 |
| Minus Two | 2025 | **yes** | yes | yes | moderate, slack-starved |
| Markiplier's Minus 7 | 2026 | no (as played) | yes | **no** | hard |

## A meta-thread: removing the human

The community keeps independently inventing the same validation idea this repo's
simulator embodies: Shooter25's practice mod / bot played brayden's strategy
perfectly for 105 nights to measure its true consistency (104–1), and Markiplier
used the same mod to read Foxy's internals. Nobody had used a simulator to
*search* for a strategy — that gap was plan 05, and it has now been walked
end-to-end once: the search derived the CAM 06/07 "Six-Seven Strat" from the
modeled route graph (2026-08-19), and the same day's decompile of the Android
build refuted it — the sourced route graph admits no two-camera cover, and the
only robust minimal cover is 4-7-10, Minus 7's own loop, independently
re-derived from source (`CAM-6-7-STRATEGY.md` carries the full post-mortem).
The lesson is the method: sim-derived candidates are hypotheses, and the
decompile is now the first validation gate they must clear.

A second search pass tested the obvious escape hatch after Six-Seven: stop asking
cameras to cover every route and exploit the decompiled monitor-entry gates instead.
Reactive monitor denial twice appeared to score 150/150 and was twice retracted.
The second false positive came from swapping two misleading exported UI states and
then reading groups 538-555 as live mask polling. The Android audit now anchors
`Multiple Touch` as the camera state and `monitorFrame` as the mask state; those
groups resolve a previously latched 45-frame defense decision only after the
300-frame office sequence. With that corrected, every tested observable gate-aware
family is 0/150 (`GATE-SEARCH.md`, `ANDROID-OFFICE-ENDGAME.md`). The methodological
lesson got sharper: source validation is iterative, and neither exciting nor
negative simulator results get promoted while a depended-on state machine is still
approximate.
