# On-device validation (bot over adb)

Started 2026-08-20 with the Moto g56 5G plugged in over USB. Goal: test the
decoded Android model's load-bearing rules against the real
`com.scottgames.fnaf2` build instead of only the event-sheet reading.
Target build confirmed on device: **v2.0.7** (versionCode 26, updated
2026-08-14) — matches the ledger's "release 7" target.

## Validation targets, ranked

1. **Consecutive-tick mask clears** (g292-294): a masked vent visitor should
   need ~5 s of *continuous* mask to be forced out (10%/s early roll), not the
   PC-style sub-second repel. This single rule refuted the whole Minus 3
   family in `tools/minus2test.mjs`; if the device disagrees, that family
   reopens.
2. Double-camera glitch absence (one `viewing` counter, atomic per touch).
3. Right-vent-light Toy Bonnie stall (g428).
4. Vent lights not draining the battery (g284).
5. Office-defense fuse by night (`time allowed` 100..45 frames) and the
   300-frame office sequence.

## Harness (tools/device/)

- `coords.sh` — touch calibration for this device (2400x1080 landscape),
  derived from labeled 100-px grid overlays on screenshots. Regenerate the
  grids per device/resolution.
- `trial-maskcamp.sh <name> <seconds> [continue|6th]` — one scripted
  mask-camp trial: continue/6th night, mute call, wind the box on CAM 11,
  drop, mask on immediately, sit masked until death; `screenrecord` captures
  the run (downscaled 1200x540 @3 Mbps to keep files small).
- `run-batch.sh <n> [night] [prefix]` — back-to-back trials plus event
  detection per capture.
- `find-events.py <mp4>` — frame-diff event locator (stdlib only): prints
  timestamp ranges with sharp visual change (overlays, flips, jumpscares) so
  clears can be timed without scrubbing video.

## Hard-won harness rules

- **The Fusion runtime polls touch by frame: zero-duration `input tap` is
  dropped roughly half the time.** Every touch must be a duration press —
  `input swipe x y x y 120`. This explained all the "did nothing" ghost runs.
- **Interactive driving is impossible**: inference/command latency between
  actions is a game over. Trials are single pre-scripted wall-clock
  sequences; analysis is post-hoc on the recording. A human watching the
  device is the best live observer (enable `settings put system
  show_touches 1`, and `pointer_location 1` for a visible crosshair).
- **Never tap blind.** The script force-foregrounds the game and checks
  `mCurrentFocus` before any input: one unguarded run landed 150 s of taps
  in the Clock app and opened a real alarm's edit dialog (cancelled,
  nothing changed).
- The bottom ~40 px belong to Android gesture navigation — keep game taps at
  y <= 1020.
- Title menu: the first press shows the `>>` cursor, the press must land on
  the item's hitbox (`Continue` at (400,730); `6th Night` at (400,880));
  hitboxes sit slightly above the painted text.
- The port swallows inputs briefly around the monitor flip; the mask press
  goes in ~0.3 s after the drop press (still inside the 50-frame night-5
  defense fuse).
- Nights start ~15 s after the press (intro + load varies): scripts must not
  time anything from the press itself; the recording's visible events are
  the clock.

## Findings so far

- **W. Foxy behaves as modeled (qualitative #2).** Three closed-loop 6th
  Night mask-camp trials died at 29/31/31 s to the W. Foxy office lunge
  (killer identified from the jumpscare frame) with the mask continuously on
  from ~11 s — the mask does not deter him, his D grows unflashed, and the
  10 s GOT-YOU cadence lands exactly in the predicted window. This also sets
  the protocol's observation ceiling: ~15-20 s of masked window per trial
  unless the hall is flashed (which breaks mask continuity).
- The closed loop works: `screenstate.py` gates every phase (wait-for-night
  before any tap fixed the too-early MUTE press; death detection ends the
  recording within ~6 s), and a 5 s wind hold fills the box to ~95% (pie
  gauge center ≈ (740, 840), radius ≈ 95 at 2400x1080 — a fill-percent
  meter is a planned upgrade).

- **Office-defense fuse behaves as modeled (qualitative).** Trial 4's mask
  landed ~3 s after the monitor drop — far past the sourced 50-frame night-5
  fuse — and the run died ~6 s after the drop, matching fuse expiry plus the
  300-frame office sequence. A timely mask (trial 5, ~0.45 s) survived the
  same phase.
- Mask-camp segments recorded cleanly (trial 5: ~26 s continuously masked,
  box-empty death at ~48 s). No vent visitor entered the masked window yet,
  so target #1 remains unmeasured — it needs more trials (6th Night has the
  higher AIs and more vent traffic).
- Custom Night is not yet unlocked on this save (Night 5 + 6th Night only);
  the in-app "Unlocks" menu is paid cheats, not night selection. Character
  isolation therefore waits until 6th Night is beaten (a bot playing Minus 7
  on-device is the fun route to that).

## Next steps

1. More trials until vent visitors land inside a masked window — that is
   still the target-#1 measurement. A no-wind variant (drop + mask at ~2 s)
   lengthens the window and overlaps the earliest vent arrivals.
2. Teach `screenstate.py` a `gameover` state (red face + "Game Over" band)
   for cleaner death timestamps, and grab the frame before the static to
   auto-identify the killer.
3. `windpct.py`: percent-fill of the pie gauge so wind holds stop exactly at
   full (coords above).
4. Longer term: a Minus 7 bot on-device to beat 6th Night and unlock Custom
   Night for character-isolated experiments.

## Bookkeeping

- Captures live in `captures/` (gitignored); delete failed runs immediately —
  raw screenrecords are large.
- Developer toggles (`show_touches`, `pointer_location`) were turned OFF at
  session end; re-enable for live observation with
  `adb shell settings put system show_touches 1` (and `pointer_location 1`).
